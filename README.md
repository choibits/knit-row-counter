<b>Why I started this project:</b><br>
My friend, who is an avid knitter, was using a simple counter app where you click and the row count goes up, but it had had no plus or minus buttons or a countdown that showed how many rows were left.
I decided to see if I could create a mobile compatible website counter with these features, since I have yet to delve into app building.<br>
Through this project, I hope to exercise some of the basic html, css, and javascript I've learned as well as the basics of uploading and committing code on github.
<br><br>

<b>Goal:</b><br>
Create a counter with:
<ul>- An input where the you can submit the number of rows they need to complete</ul>
<ul>- A counter display to track the # rows you've completed and a countdown display that tracks the number of rows left to complete</ul>
<ul>- A - button that that decreases the counter display by 1 and increases the countdown display by 1 everytime you click it</ul>
<ul>- A + button that that increases the counter display by 1 and decreases the countdown display by 1 everytime you click it</ul>
<ul>- A reset button that resets the number in the display</ul>
<ul>- A pop up that let's you know you've completed the rows you submitted</ul>
<br><br>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>
I was able to exercise my knowledge of building buttons via html that upon clicking would update a numerical value as desired via javascript. I utilized css in order to update the position, font weight, and padding of the buttons of the html elements created.
<br><br>

<b>How I could improve this project:</b><br>
I definitely feel that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of alignment of the buttons/button size and font size, especially on mobile. I heard that react could make this much easier, so when I learn more react I'd like to revisit this project. I feel like this is a really simple mobile app that I could make once I get further into learning about app development.
