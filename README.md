<b>Why I started this project:</b><br>
My friend, who is an avid knitter, was using a simple counter app where you click and the row count goes up, but it had had no plus or minus buttons or a countdown that showed how many rows were left.
I decided to see if I could create a mobile compatible website counter with these features, since I have yet to delve into app building.<br>
I hope to exercise some of the basic html, css, and javascript I've learned as well as the basics of uploading code to github.
<br><br>

<b>Goal:</b><br>
Create a counter that increases everytime you hit the + button and decreases everytime you hit the - button.
Create a separate countdown number that you can enter that shows how many rows you have left that decreases everytime you hit the + button and that increases everytime you hit the - button.
<br><br>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>
I was able to exercise my knowledge of building buttons via html that upon clicking would update a numerical value as desired via javascript. I utilized css in order to update the position, font weight, and padding of the buttons of the html elements created.
<br><br>

<b>How I could improve this project:</b><br>
I definitely feel that there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of alignment of the buttons and font size, especially on mobile. The buttons are smaller on mobile and look different for some reason.
I heard that react could make this much easier, so when I learn more react I'd like to revisit this project. I feel like this is a really simple mobile app that I could make once I get there as well!
I also think my code is on the messy end. I'd like to clean it up so it's easy for people to see
